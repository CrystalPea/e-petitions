Feature: Joe views all archived petition
  In order to see what petitions were created in the past
  As Joe, a member of the general public
  I want to be able to view all archived petitions

  Background:
    Given these archived petitions exist:
      | action                   | state    | signature_count |  created_at |
      | Wombles are great        | closed   | 835             |  2012-01-01 |
      | Common People            | closed   | 639             |  2014-01-01 |
      | Save the planet          | closed   | 243             |  2014-01-01 |
      | Wombles to Parliament    | closed   | 243             |  2013-01-01 |
      | Free gig tickets         | rejected |                 |  2013-01-01 |
      | Wombles are &*!%         | hidden   |                 |  2013-02-01 |
      | Bring back the Wombles   | stopped  |                 |  2013-03-01 |

  Scenario:
    When I view all petitions from the home page
    And I follow "Archived petitions"
    Then I should see "Published petitions" within ".//h1[@class='page-title']"
    And I should see the following list of archived petitions:
      | Wombles are great         | 835 signatures |
      | Common People             | 639 signatures |
      | Save the planet           | 243 signatures |
      | Wombles to Parliament     | 243 signatures |
    And the markup should be valid
    When I follow "Rejected petitions" within ".//nav[@id='other-search-lists']"
    Then I should see "Rejected petitions" within ".//h1[@class='page-title']"
    And I should see the following list of archived petitions:
      | Free gig tickets          | Rejected       |
    And the markup should be valid
    When I follow "All petitions" within ".//nav[@id='other-search-lists']"
    Then I should see "All petitions" within ".//h1[@class='page-title']"
    And I should see the following list of archived petitions:
      | Wombles are great         | 835 signatures |
      | Common People             | 639 signatures |
      | Save the planet           | 243 signatures |
      | Wombles to Parliament     | 243 signatures |
      | Free gig tickets          | Rejected       |
    And I should not see "Wombles are &*!%"
    And I should not see "Bring back the Wombles"
    And the markup should be valid

  Scenario: Downloading the JSON data for archived petitions
    Given I am on the archived petitions page
    Then I should see the following list of archived petitions:
      | Wombles are great         | 835 signatures |
      | Common People             | 639 signatures |

      | Wombles to Parliament     | 243 signatures |
      | Free gig tickets          | Rejected       |
    And the markup should be valid
    When I click the JSON link
    Then I should be on the archived petitions JSON page
    And the JSON should be valid

  Scenario: Downloading the CSV data for archived petitions
    Given I am on the archived petitions page
    Then I should see the following list of archived petitions:
      | Wombles are great         | 835 signatures |

      | Wombles to Parliament     | 243 signatures |
      | Free gig tickets          | Rejected       |
    And the markup should be valid
    When I click the CSV link
    Then I should get a download with the filename "all-petitions-2010â€“2015.csv"
